The Rocket League Gym is a python API that can be used to treat the game [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com) as though it were an [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com)-style environment for Reinforcement Learning projects. This API must be used with the accompanying Bakkesmod plugin.

## Requirements
* A Windows 10 PC
* Rocket League (Both Steam and Epic are supported)
* [Bakkesmod](https://www.bakkesmod.com)
* The RLGym plugin for Bakkesmod (It's installed automatically by pip)
* Python >= 3.7
